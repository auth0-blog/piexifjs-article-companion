    "**TL;DR:** The photos you take on your smartphone are made up of more than just pictures. They also contain Exif metadata, which provides additional information about each photo, such as when and where it was taken, as well as other data that could be used to compromise your privacy or even incriminate you. In this article, you’ll learn about the Exif metadata format and how to use JavaScript and the *Piexfjs* library to find and read this data, edit it, and even erase it from your photos.\n",

    "## There's More Than Just Pictures in Your Photos\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass adoption of smartphones — essentially portable, sensor-rich, location-aware, always-networked computers — has given us two major consequences whose effects on privacy and security we don’t yet completely understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. More people than ever have a camera that’s usually within arm’s reach.\n",
    "2. By default, the photos taken with these cameras can give away sensitive information, and many users are unaware that it’s happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to picture data, photos taken with smartphones and modern digital cameras contain *metadata*, which is additional information about the photo. This metadata is stored in a format called **Exif**, which is short for [Exchangeable image file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif), a continually evolving standard for information added to digital image and sound recordings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In photos, Exif can include information such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The make and model of the device used to take the photo\n",
    "* The date and time when the photo was taken, down to the millisecond\n",
    "* Where the photo was taken, with the accuracy of GPS\n",
    "* The orientation of the device when the photo was taken\n",
    "* Which direction the camera was facing\n",
    "* The altitude at which the photo was taken\n",
    "* The speed at which the camera was moving when the photo was taken\n",
    "* Various camera settings, including zoom, aperture, and flash\n",
    "\n",
    "This metadata is useful for sorting, cataloging, and searching through photos, which is why the Exif standard was defined. However, it also introduces privacy and security concerns that many users don’t take into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information security professionals tell cautionary tales about Exif metadata. [The 2012 privacy incident involving antivirus company founder John McAfee](https://www.wired.com/2012/12/oops-did-vice-just-give-away-john-mcafees-location-with-this-photo/) is a popular one. In his DEF CON 23 presentation, [*Confessions of a Professional Cyber Stalker*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVJGY2bZ-Ko), security analyst Ken Westin talked about the privacy problems that Exif can cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "[The January 6th storming of the United States Capitol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol) is full of examples of incriminating Exif. Many of the participants posted photos and videos to a social media site that didn’t take the precaution of “scrubbing” their Exif data during the upload process. Combined with the site’s poor security, these recordings provided law enforcement with evidence that clearly placed the people who made them at the scene of the crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being the security-conscious developers that I suspect you are, you’re probably asking yourself questions like these:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How can I programmatically detect and read the Exif metadata in photos?\n",
    "* How can I alter, add, or erase Exif metadata programmatically?\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will answer these questions with the help of JavaScript and the *Piexifjs* library. Along the way, you’ll use not just your programming skills, but you’ll do some detective work as well!\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the exercises below, you’ll use images containing Exif metadata. Before continuing, you should [download these images](https://github.com/auth0-blog/piexifjs-article-companion/tree/main/images) from [this article’s companion Github repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/piexifjs-article-companion) and put them into a directory named `images`. [You can find all the code here](https://github.com/auth0-blog/piexifjs-article-companion/blob/main/article-code.js).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The *Piexifjs* Library\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of JavaScript libraries that can access the Exif data in digital photos. This article uses [***Piexifjs***](https://github.com/hMatoba/piexifjs). Unlike most other JavaScript Exif libraries, *Piexif* not only allows you to *read* Exif data, but *edit* and *erase* it as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Piexifjs* is available as a Node.js package and can be installed by using `npm` as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "{% prism bash %}\n",
    "npm install piexifjs\n",
    "{% endprism %}\n",
    "\n",
    "You can include *Piexifjs* directly in an HTML page by linking to [`piexif.js`](https://github.com/hMatoba/piexifjs/blob/master/piexif.js).\n",
    "\n",
    "This article features code that make use of the *Piexifjs* Node.js package to read, edit, and erase Exif data from a set of sample photos. I recommend that you enter the code into your favourite JavaScript console application (such as `node`) or an interactive JavaScript environment (such as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) running a [JavaScript kernel](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript)).\n",

    "### Reasons to Remove Exif Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "Exif metadata adds a whole new level of information to digital photographs, and a number of things that users, developers, and organizations must consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy is an obvious consideration. A single photo’s GPS metadata can give away your location at a specific date and time. What’s far more valuable is the *aggregate* GPS from someone’s camera roll, as it contains patterns that can be analyzed to determine where they live, work, and the places they frequent on their daily routine. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the more reputable social networking services strip this information when you share your photos online. Remember that this only means that your photos on your social network gallery don’t contain GPS data. There’s no guarantee that the service didn’t record the location information for advertiser data mining purposes before removing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sets of Exif metadata, such as the combination of make, model, settings, and even preferred camera orientation, can be used to associate a set of photos with a specific person. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some photographers are more concerned about the secrets of their craft than privacy when it comes to their photos’ metadata. They don’t want to give away the camera settings they used in taking pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons to Retain or Add Exif Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the original reasons why the Exif metadata format was developed was to make it easier to automate the process of cataloging, sorting, and searching through a collection of digital photographs. Exif makes it possible to search for photos taken during a certain time period, with a certain device, or at a certain location. Other tags, such as the `Copyright` tag, make it possible to search for photos taken by a specific photographer, as well as assert one’s copyright.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you should generally remove Exif data from personal photos before posting them online, you’ll probably want to keep copies of the originals with the Exif data intact. You may not want the world at large to know the details behind your photos, but you might!\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the `ImageDescription` tag was intended to store a description of the image, you can also use it to store other helpful text information related to the photo, such as tags to classify the image or instructions for processing and editing the photo.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re posting photos online as a public record (perhaps you’re a journalist or want to document a place or event), you may want to leave its Exif metadata intact. This is a judgment call that you’ll have to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exif metadata is particularly useful in mobile applications that record simultaneous combinations of visual, date/time, and location information. For example, a technician might be required to take “before” and “after” photos of repair work that they did, providing a record of where, when, and how the work was done.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Things to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the different tags recorded by the iPhone and Android devices used to take the photographs in this article, different cameras record different sets of Exif tags. Photo editing software often writes information to different tags or adds their own custom tags. This additional metadata can often be a hint that a photo has been edited.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a concept in wildlife photography called [*Ethical Exif*](https://petapixel.com/2018/07/16/ethical-exif-ee-for-wildlife-photos/), which provides a description of the ethical standards followed when taking a photo. It includes information such as the health and stress level of the animal in the photo, how long the animal was in captivity, and if the animal was transported from its habitat for the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are the messages that camera-using mobile apps display when first used. They usually say something along the lines of “This app makes use of the camera. Is that all right with you?”, but most of them don’t make it clear that the camera adds location and other metadata to each photo it takes. If you write mobile apps that use the camera, you might want to inform the user of this.\n"
